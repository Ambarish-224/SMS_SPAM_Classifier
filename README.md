# SMS_SPAM_Classifier

I have used an naive bayes model along with natural language processing to create this model.


Porter Stemmer, Bag of words are the nlp techniques used for text preprocessing
This model will be able to classify a message as spam or ham with an accuracy of 97 percent.

The machine learning algorithm used here is GaussianNB and MultinomialNB which uses bayes theorem from probability.
